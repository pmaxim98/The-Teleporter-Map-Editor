#   Map editor for 'The Teleporter'

A repository with an external map editor for **_The Teleporter_** - a 2D game I made in my spare time.

####  Context
I created this project mainly to improve my non-existent skills in _C#_ (and also _.NET Framework_). The game is written in C++14 (with the help of the SFML library) and it represents a 2D Top-Down Shooter that is played on a tile-based map. Initially, I made the map editor incorporated directly into the game but the GUI was a chore to modify or improve so I decided to make an external one, this time in C#.


####  Technology
* Microsoft Visual C# **2015** with target framework: .NET Framework **4.5.2**:
  * WinForms (GUI)
  * WPF (GUI)
  * GDI+ (Drawing the map)


####  Goals
* Simple and in-theme GUI.
* High-performance when working with relatively large maps.
* Handy features and tools that help in editing the properties and tiles of the map.
